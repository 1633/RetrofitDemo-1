{"name":"Retrofitdemo","tagline":"Retrofit android demo","body":"### Custom mode help\r\n\r\nThe standard android system have many font files. Different font files used in different place. Normally we just change the default Roboto-Regular.ttf font file to change system font. But in some place, such as Dialpad, will use other font. Also there have a lot of custom ROMs and OME ROMs, some of that will change the default system font, such as Sony Xperia devices using the SoMARegular.ttf font.\r\n\r\nIn CUSTOM MODE you can define the files list you want to change. When you set a font to system, Fonter will popup this file list let you choose the files you want to replace. **BUT, There are some risks to cause device bootloop if you replace some files,such as if you replace SoMABold.ttf font on Sony Xperia will cause bootloop. ** So please careful when using CUSTOM MODE. \r\n\r\nThe standard Android have those fonts in /system/fonts/ folder:\r\n\r\n* AndroidClock.ttf = Stock Digital Clock Widget & Dock/Desk Clock (\"Clock\" in App Drawer).\r\n* AndroidClock_Highlight.ttf = Lock Screen Clock.\r\n* AndroidClock_Solid.ttf = Unsure of its purpose.\r\n* Clockopia.ttf = Former Stock clock font but, seems unused by the system in Android 4.0+.\r\n* DroidSans.ttf = Apparently unused in Android 4.0+. System font from previous Android versions.\r\n* DroidSans-Bold = Apparently unused in Android 4.0+. Bold system font from previous Android versions.\r\n* Roboto-Regular.ttf = This is the one always referred to as the \"System Font.\" It yields the most noticeable results and, is the one all the font changer apps alter. Affects almost all text on your device.\r\n* Roboto-Bold = The bold version of Roboto. Not seen everywhere but it is seen. Opening your Gmail app to an email in your inbox will allow you to see Regular and Bold in the same occurrence. The sender's name will be in bold and their address will be in Regular. I recommend changing if you have a bold version of your replacement font.\r\n* Roboto-Italic = Unsure of its frequency of use but, it's not often. However, if you have a matching Italic font, it can't hurt to use it.\r\n* Roboto-BoldItalic = Unsure of its frequency of use but, it's not often. However, if you have a matching Bold Italic font, it can't hurt to use it.\r\n\r\nThere are also various other languages of the Roboto font in the \"System/fonts\" folder. If a particular language is your default, I'm sure it's obvious what adjustments you would need to make with regards to font replacement.\r\n\r\nmore info: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1847203\r\n\r\nnow, let's see how to use the CUSTOM MODE.\r\n\r\n### 1.
